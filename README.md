# The Application of Parametric and Nonparametric Regression to Predict The Missing Well Log Data

This is the repository for our attemps on predicting missing well log that recently published at Indonesian Journal of Geoscience (IJOG). The full paper is available to download here: [DOI: 10.17014/ijog.8.3.385-399](http://ijog.bgl.esdm.go.id/index.php/IJOG/article/view/720)(https://ijog.geologi.esdm.go.id/index.php/IJOG/article/view/720)) 

The jupyter notebook of each methods used in this paper are available in the subfolder [Scripts](https://github.com/panjoel4/ML-missingWellLogPrediction/tree/master/SCRIPTS/JUPYTER)

The paper is also the initial idea of our recently launched web-application [WellCast](https://wellcast.geovartha.id). WellCast is a web-application tool for predicting missing well log data using the machine learning workflow. In this application, we used gradient boost method (tree-based algorithm) which was adapted from the result of [SPE GCS ML Challenge 2021](https://github.com/Geovartha/spe-gcs-ml-challenge-2021-/blob/main/spe_gcs_ml_challenge_2021.ipynb).
